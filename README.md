# FizzBuzz_TDD

## Aim of the project
This project was mainly intended to help me practice content learned in clas, TDD and RSpec testing.

## What it does?
Numbers from 1 to 50 are printed on the screen. For every number that is diviseble by 3, the word "Fizz" is printed instead. If it is divisible by 5, the word "Buzz" is printed and if it is both divisble by 3 and 5, "Fizzbuzz" is printed.

### Concepts applied
- **Red -> Green -> Refactor**
In the **Red** stage, tests were written intentionally to fail. The **Green** stage, tests were written in order for the code to pass. In the **Refactor**, code was altered in order to not repeat myself and improve the quality of the code written.
